Attractive
===========

Renders Peter de Jong [strange attractors](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/peterdejong/) for your entertainment!  
  
A small project of mine, but I am proud of the results and they are actually interesting so I thought I'd put it here.  
  
>In dynamical systems, an attractor is a set of physical properties toward which a system tends to evolve, regardless of the starting conditions of the system.  
An attractor is called strange if it has a fractal structure. This is often the case when the dynamics on it are chaotic, but strange nonchaotic attractors also exist.

Speficially, the Peter de Jong attractor is an attractor defined by this system:

The visual representation of the attractor is a point cloud of many iterations of the system.
